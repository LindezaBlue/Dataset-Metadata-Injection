A lightweight Python tool for adding Kohya/A1111-compatible tag frequency metadata to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) safetensors files. This tool fixes missing tag metadata in LoRA files trained with AI-Toolkit or similar programs, ensuring proper display in A1111/Forge/ForgeNeo.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** — [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Windows OS** — Batch file automation (Linux support planned)
- **.safetensors LoRA file** — Your trained model
- **Training dataset** (optional) — Images with corresponding `.txt` caption files (only needed for Normal Mode)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LindezaBlue/Dataset-Metadata-Injection.git
   cd Dataset-Metadata-Injection
   ```

2. No additional setup required! The batch files handle dependency installation automatically.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Gradio Web Interface

The easiest way to use this tool is through the visual web interface.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

**On first run, the program automatically creates two folders:**
- `Model to Repair/` — Place your LoRA files here
- `Updated LoRA/` — Updated files will be saved here

#### For Normal Mode (with dataset):

1. Place your LoRA file (`.safetensors` format) in the `Model to Repair/` folder

2. (Optional) Place your dataset subfolder inside `Model to Repair/`  
   Example: `Model to Repair/my_character/`  
   - Place all your training images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) in this folder
   - Ensure each image has a matching `.txt` caption file with comma-separated tags  
     Example: `image1.png` → `image1.txt` containing `1girl, blue hair, smiling, outdoors`

   **OR** use a dataset folder anywhere on your system (can browse to it in the UI)

#### For Manual Mode (without dataset):

1. Place your LoRA file (`.safetensors` format) in the `Model to Repair/` folder
2. That's it! You'll enter trigger words directly in the UI

### Step 2: Launch the Gradio Interface

1. Double-click `Run Gradio UI.bat`  
   The batch file will automatically:  
   - Detect your Python installation  
   - Create a virtual environment *(first run only)*
   - Install required dependencies *(gradio, safetensors, torch CPU-only, etc.—first run only)*  
   - Launch the web interface in your default browser at **http://127.0.0.1:7860**

### Step 3: Use the Web Interface

The interface guides you step-by-step with two modes:

#### Normal Mode (with dataset):

1. **Select your LoRA file**  
   - Choose your **LoRA Filename** from the dropdown

2. **Select your dataset**  
   - Choose a **Dataset Subfolder** from the dropdown, OR
   - Click **📁 Select Dataset Folder** to browse to any folder, OR
   - Paste a custom path directly

3. **Scan the dataset**  
   - Click **🔍 Scan Dataset / Parse Tags**  
   - The tool will automatically read all `.txt` caption files and count tag frequencies  
   - Results appear in the **Tag Frequencies** box with status feedback

4. **Inject the metadata**  
   - Click **💾 Inject Metadata & Save**  
   - A new LoRA file with embedded metadata will be created  
   - Find it in the `Updated LoRA/` folder (filename ends with `_with_tags.safetensors`)

#### Manual Mode (without dataset):

1. **Select your LoRA file**  
   - Choose your **LoRA Filename** from the dropdown

2. **Enable manual mode**  
   - Check the **"Manual trigger word mode"** checkbox

3. **Enter trigger words**  
   - Type your trigger words (comma-separated) in the text box
   - Set the tag frequency (default: 1)
   - Watch the **live preview** update in real-time

4. **Inject the metadata**  
   - When the status shows 🟢 **Ready**, click **💾 Inject Metadata & Save**
   - Find the updated LoRA in `Updated LoRA/` folder

5. When you're done, just close the browser tab and Terminal/CLI to exit the program.

### Linux Users

A launch script `run_gradio_ui.sh` is provided for Linux systems.  
It mirrors the Windows batch file, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and launching the Gradio UI.  

⚠️ **Linux users, please test this script and report any issues**, especially with automatic browser opening or dependency installation.
*(I currently am not able to test if this works on Linux systems so feedback is appreciated, Thank you!)*

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Metadata Fields Added

This tool injects the following Kohya SS / A1111-compatible fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ss_tag_frequency` | JSON object mapping tags to occurrence counts |
| `ss_dataset_dirs` | Dataset folder names and image counts |
| `ss_resolution` | Training resolution (default: `1024,1024`) |
| `ss_num_train_images` | Total number of training images |

### Dependencies

All dependencies are auto-installed in an isolated virtual environment:

- **safetensors** — Safe model file loading/saving
- **torch** (CPU-only) — Minimal PyTorch for tensor operations
- **gradio** — Web-based UI framework
- **packaging** — Version management utilities

### System Requirements

- **Python:** 3.11 or later (auto-detected from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python`)
- **Disk Space:** ~500MB for virtual environment
- **Platform:** Windows *(Linux support in development)*

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Missing Dataset Folder/Safetensor Model"

**Problem:** Files not found in expected locations

**Solutions:**
- Verify your LoRA file is in the `Model to Repair/` folder
- For Normal Mode: verify dataset folder exists (in `Model to Repair/` or custom path)
- For Manual Mode: no dataset needed, just the LoRA file

### "Python not found"

**Problem:** Python installation not detected

**Solutions:**
- Install Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Use "Install for current user" option during installation
- Script auto-searches `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\`

### Virtual Environment Issues

**Solution:** Delete the `venv/` folder and re-run the batch file to recreate it cleanly

### Caption File Format

Ensure your `.txt` files use comma-separated tags:
```
# Correct
1girl, blue hair, smiling, outdoors, school uniform

# Incorrect (will not parse properly)
1girl blue hair smiling outdoors school uniform
```
